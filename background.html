    <h2>THEORY BACKGROUND</h2>

    <h3>Anatomo-physiological reminder</h3>

    <p>The spine is divided into three movable sections, from top to bottom: the cervical spine (C1 to C7), the thoracic spine (T1 to T12), and the lumbar spine (L1 to L5). At these levels, the vertebrae articulate with each other.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>From the side, the spine displays physiological curves that are perfectly balanced with each other. These curves are called "kyphosis" and "lordosis." They alternate anatomically : the cervical spine in lordosis is balanced by the thoracic spine in kyphosis.</p>

    </figure>



    <p>The spine contains the spinal cord and the cauda equina nerves, which travel through the spinal canal, the central part of the vertebrae. The spinal cord continues from the brain and directly distributes nerves (nerve roots) at the neck and thoracic levels. The spinal cord ends at the level of the first lumbar vertebra, giving rise to a bundle of roots that supply the perineum and the legs.</p>

    <p>An injury to the cervical or thoracic spine directly threatens the spinal cord. The spinal cord is extremely fragile, and the chances of recovery in cases of paralysis are low. An injury at the cervical level can cause tetraplegia (complete paralysis) or tetraparesis (incomplete paralysis). Indeed, a lesion acts like a barrier, causing an interruption of nerve impulses below the injury site.</p>

    <h3>Pathologies of the spinal cord following trauma</h3>

    <p>Paraplegia results from damage to the spinal cord and its roots or from significant damage to the cauda equina roots. Strictly speaking, paraplegia means paralysis of the lower limbs, but in practice, it is almost always of spinal origin. Tetraplegia refers to paralysis caused by a cervical injury (tetra meaning four limbs). Together, these types of injuries account for about one-third of spinal cord injuries. Accidents are the leading cause, accounting for 70 to 80% of cases.</p>

    <h3>How do you know if a victim needs to be immobilized ?</h3>

    <p>The Nexus score (National Emergency X-Radiography Utilization Study) is used to determine whether a patient should undergo a cervical X-ray after a trauma. If the Nexus score is unfavorable, there is a suspicion of a spinal injury. Therefore, immobilization of the spine is required from the scene of the accident until the X-ray room at the hospital.
    The Nexus score is determined by five criteria. If the patient meets even one of these criteria, spinal immobilization is mandatory:</p>

    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
      <li><strong>Criterion 1 - </strong>Spontaneous pain upon palpation of the spine?</li>
      <li><strong>Criterion 2 - </strong>Sensory or motor deficit, or absence of sensation/tingling?</li>
      <li><strong>Criterion 3 - </strong>Abnormal level of consciousness?</li>
      <li><strong>Criterion 4 - </strong>Impaired communication?</li>
      <li><strong>Criterion 5 - </strong>Distracting pain of traumatic origin?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Change of equipment</h3>

    <p>Belgium is one of the first countries to remove cervical collars from its ambulances due to their numerous harmful effects, and to stop using the "BaXstrap" board as an immobilization method for transport, both for practical reasons and for comfort. This equipment, which had been used for about thirty years, has been called into question by numerous Scandinavian studies. Head blocks have therefore replaced them, alongside the scoop stretcher, in all Belgian ambulances since January 1, 2024.</p>

spineboard/]</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <strong>Change of the BaXstrap board</strong> because it is too flat and hard, causing discomfort and increasing agitation. <br><strong>Change of the cervical collar </strong>because there are only two models with limited sizes ; it exerts unnatural traction on the cervical spine, and some movement is still possible, which can lead to additional injuries.

    <strong>WARNING: </strong>The measurements indicated are not applicable to all patients. A test was conducted on one individual, and for THIS person, a flexion, extension, and rotation of 30° were measured (source: lamine.net).

    </figure>

    <p>This experience demonstrates that the application of a cervical collar causes a displacement of approximately 1 cm between C1 and C2. This traction, which is not visible to the naked eye but is clearly observable and measurable both clinically and radiologically, has a high likelihood of creating a spinal cord injury due to stretching (a spinal cord injury or nerve root injury leads to a loss of motor, sensory, and/or autonomic functions). In other words, the use of a cervical collar worsens the condition of a person who already has an injury. (source: lamine.net) </p>

    <p>The Scoop Stretcher is the board that replaces the BaXstrap board. With it, we can lift someone from the ground due to its ability to be opened into two hemispheres. Additionally, this board is anatomical thanks to its curvature and the slit in the middle. </p>

Adjustable-Immobilizer/dp/B0B7XFXG83]</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The cervical collar has been replaced by two blocks on either side of the head, placed on a base : the head blocks. Once this device is placed on the scoop stretcher, the victim's head is secured and cannot move.</p>

    <h3>Pediatric issue</h3>

    <p>For the Scoop Stretcher to be effective, the patient's height must be at least 120 cm. Additionally, for younger patients, the Head Blocks are too high and do not adequately support the head. This new recommendation is therefore very beneficial for adults but is incompatible with babies and young children.</p>
    
    <p>The Pedi-Pac, the only tool currently available for immobilizing the spine of children, will also be removed from ambulances because it requires the use of a cervical collar (manufacturer’s standard) and cannot be used with a scoop stretcher.</p>

    <h3>Creation of prototypes</h3>

    <p>We contacted trainers from EPSAH, specifically three paramedics including an emergency nurse, to guide us effectively. We were able to ask our scientific and practical questions and benefit from their feedback on the positive and negative aspects. This allowed us to receive concrete and honest opinions, helping us to adapt to their field needs.</p>
