    <h2>PROTOTYPE I</h2>

    <p>For our first prototype, we drew inspiration from the head blocks and the scoop stretcher (used for adults). After careful consideration, the idea of two "sleeves" to slide over each hemisphere of the scoop seemed to be the most effective and feasible at our scale. To better visualize our concept, we created a drawing using an application.</p>

    <figure>

    <p>One of our primary objectives for the prototype was to retain the curvature effect of the scoop stretcher (separating the hemispheres to lift the patient from either side like a spoon before closing underneath) through the division of its two hemispheres. Unlike some current non-functional devices (such as the mandated cervical collar) that do not allow this, we addressed the issue. Thus, creating two sleeves was a clear solution. Since they are not attached, the two hemispheres can work independently before being assembled and closed.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>To achieve this, we purchased transparent plastic tablecloths (used to protect tables), which we cut and then fused with an iron to create a sleeve open at both ends. This allows us to slide it through the bottom of the scoop stretcher, where the patient’s feet usually rest. We also made holes in the tablecloth at strategic points corresponding to the handles of the scoop stretcher, allowing for the passage of straps and enabling the paramedics to handle the scoop stretcher.</p>

    <p>Initially, we would have preferred to slide the sleeves through the top to have only one opening and reduce the time needed to fit them by taking the shortest path. However, with the closure that connects the two hemispheres of the scoop stretcher, the sleeves could have worn out and torn more quickly. Therefore, we opted for the second solution : sliding the sleeves through the bottom of the scoop and creating two Velcro closures, one on the top and one on the bottom. By sliding them from the bottom, nothing obstructs the passage of the sleeves, optimizing the time, and reducing the risk of the sleeves tearing.</p>

    <p>To improve the comfort of babies and children on the scoop stretcher, which is relatively hard and can quickly cause pressure sores (wounds due to prolonged pressure on a specific area of the skin), we asked our physical education teacher if it would be possible to obtain a small gym mat to cut to the appropriate dimensions to address this issue. She kindly agreed, giving us the opportunity to find an adhesive capable of bonding these two complex materials. Once we found a suitable adhesive, the assembly was completed, and the issue of discomfort and agitation was resolved.</p>

    <p>The scoop stretcher cannot be used for children primarily due to its width, which is much greater than that of smaller children, allowing them to move around—contrary to what is desired in this situation. Since the tool we are creating must take up as little space as possible in the ambulance (storage space is limited), the idea of having a pediatric scoop stretcher in every emergency vehicle was unfeasible. To address this issue, we created two sizes of foam wedges from pool noodles : two with a diameter of 6 cm and two with a diameter of 3 cm, which fit the widths of children measuring 15 cm, 21 cm, or 27 cm. This results in four possible scoop widths, including the base width (adult), either alone or in combination. To attach them, we applied Velcro to strategic points on the wedges and the scoop stretcher, ensuring a secure fit. Velcro is a material commonly used in Emergency Medical Services.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="images/protoone4.png" alt="photo 4" style="width:50%" class="center">

    <table style="width:100%">
      <tr>
        <td>Wedges</td>
        <td>6cm + 3cm</td>
        <td>6cm</td>
        <td>3cm</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Length</td>
        <td>15cm</td>
        <td>21cm</td>
        <td>27cm</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>To perform our calculation, we took the width of the half-scoop stretcher (20 cm), subtracted the space for the handles (-6.5 cm), and considered the space between the two hemispheres (6 cm). We aimed for approximate widths of 15 cm, 20 cm, and 25 cm, and found an alternative using the 3 cm and 6 cm diameter wedges. It is possible to adjust the wedges with Velcro in an offset manner (not directly facing each other) to gain or lose a few centimeters, allowing us to perfectly adapt to each child's body size.</p>

    <p>To immobilize the spine, we adapted the principle of the head blocks. For this, we glued two pool noodles together and cut an "oval" hole to check for any external bleeding, such as internal bleeding that might flow through natural openings (in this case, the ears), for the same reasons as with adult models. To secure the noodles together and to ensure better hygiene, we wrapped them with waterproof tape, which also makes cleaning easier (e.g., for ear bleeding). Hygiene and disinfection are extremely important in medical follow-up.</p>

    </figure>

    <p>Unlike the adult model, our Prototype 1 does not have a "plate" (base) at the head where the head blocks are usually fixed. We attached Velcro to the upper area of the sleeve to secure the head blocks directly and easily. To avoid irritating the child's skin, we applied the female side of the Velcro to the sleeve.</p>

    <p>To recreate a three-point attachment using straps (across the chest, at the pelvis, and above the knees), we created three adjustable straps, each equipped with a quick-release buckle. These straps attach easily to the scoop stretcher by wrapping around it and passing through the buckle.</p>

    <p>After completing our Prototype I, we consulted with professionals : three paramedics, including an emergency nurse. We sought their opinions on the effectiveness of our tool. They noted both positive and negative aspects ; some features were considered optional and did not affect the overall effectiveness of our first prototype.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="images/protoone9.jpg" alt="photo 9" style="width:60%" class="center">
    </figure>

    <p>The idea of a sleeve to be slid over each hemisphere was well received and validated. The mats adhered to the sleeve were also appreciated. The only comment was that if we were to create a second prototype, we should find a slightly more comfortable material.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="images/protoone10.png" alt="photo 10" style="width:60%" class="center">
    </figure>

    <p>They also approved our use of Velcro rather than, for example, snap buttons. If paramedics notice that the Velcro is wearing out, they have time to address the issue and inform their logistics service to replace the worn and less practical equipment, though it remains functional. In contrast, a snap button could break in the middle of an intervention, rendering the rest of the equipment nonfunctional or defective.</p>

      <img src="images/protoone11.png" alt="photo 11" style="width:60%" class="center">
    </figure>

    <p>However, our three professionals pointed out that our head blocks were too high for an infant's head, and the straps did not make contact with the baby's head. We then proposed to redesign the head blocks, cutting them to ¾ of their original size, with the option to tilt them. By doing this, the holes should disappear due to the reduced size. They approved our idea and confirmed that they would still be able to see the ears with a little adjustment.</p>

      <img src="images/protoone12.jpg" alt="photo 12" style="width:60%" class="center">

    <p>For the chin and forehead straps, we had to reconsider the material. Indeed, made of faux leather, they were too rigid, slippery, and not very anatomical.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="images/protoone13.jpg" alt="photo 13" style="width:60%" class="center">
    </figure>

    <p>They also mentioned that while the idea of the wedges was good, for the second prototype, it was crucial to find a more comfortable and less rigid material. It is important not to try to block or pin down the child to immobilize them. If the child feels trapped, they are likely to struggle, which could cause additional injuries. The goal should be to keep the spine aligned while allowing some movement of the arms and legs. Additionally, freeing the arms provides potential access for administering medication.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="images/protoone14.jpg" alt="photo 14" style="width:60%" class="center">
    </figure>

    <p>They also advised us that two straps would be more than sufficient given the size of the children who could be accommodated by the device. We also discussed the width of the straps, which should be made wider. The closing buckles needed to be replaced with more robust ones, which we had originally planned; however, the ones used were adequate for the prototype.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="images/protoone15.png" alt="photo 15" style="width:60%" class="center">
    </figure>

    <p>Finally, several professionals recommended that we create a base for attaching the head blocks, similar to the adult model. This base, which is originally secured with an H-strap (an H-shaped strap extending from the chin to the ends of the scoop), cannot be used for the pediatric model. While this attachment is necessary to connect the two major components (the scoop and head blocks), it can quickly compress the chin, causing significant agitation in the young patient who may not understand that it is for their own good. To address this issue, we improved our prototype by developing a system that effectively integrates our two essential tools.</p>
