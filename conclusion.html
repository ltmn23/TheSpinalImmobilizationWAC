    <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

    <h3>Futurs changes</h3>

    <p>For the continuation of our project, we have planned several modifications to ensure optimal comfort for our young patients.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Ball matress : </strong>We plan to retain the polystyrene bead mattress but are considering removing the internal segmentations. While we originally segmented the mattress to prevent excessive bead movement, allowing the beads to move freely and smoothing the mattress by hand might be the better option. This change will enable the beads to better conform to each individual's morphology.</li>
      <li><strong>Head straps : </strong>We aim to reduce the width of the head straps. Currently, they are too wide for an infant's head, which may cause them to slip or not position properly.</li>
      <li><strong>Base straps : </strong>We also plan to shorten the straps used to secure the base to the scoop. This adjustment will minimize any additional movement.</li>
      <li><strong>Head strap material : </strong>We will test different materials for the head straps to ensure they are hypoallergenic. The rest of the fabrics used are repurposed from prehospital equipment, so we did not need to investigate their allergenic properties.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Following these modifications, we will conduct new tests, seek feedback from professionals, and evaluate the comfort of our prototype with healthy children.
    </p><p>
    We hope our project will be well-received. We have already received positive and encouraging feedback from some pediatric health professionals following brief presentations, which motivates us to continue working towards further development.
