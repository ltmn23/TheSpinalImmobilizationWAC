    <h2>PROTOTYPE II</h2>

    <p>Our second prototype represents a significant improvement over the first. This work was done after considering the constructive feedback from our professionals and seeking to replace or enhance what we had.</p>

    <p>We have retained the two sleeves, which are still slid on from the bottom of the scoop for their durability. </p>

    <p>The material has been changed. We decided to use a more durable and hygienic fabric. This fabric is the same type used for all tools found in ambulances: a plastic-coated fabric. To obtain this, we repurposed old, decommissioned vacuum mattresses. We also kept the polystyrene beads from these mattresses for other parts of the prototype.</p>

    <p>To address the lack of comfort of the scoop, which contributed to the agitation of younger patients, we decided to replace the gym mat from the first prototype with a bead mat. This new mat is segmented by several stitches to keep the beads in place. These mats were sewn onto the inner side of the sleeves by one of our acquaintances, allowing us to achieve perfectly executed seams.</p>

    <p>For the wedges, we chose long fabric tubes filled with beads, eliminating the Velcro which, upon further consideration, no longer seemed very useful. We found that the straps effectively hold everything in place.</p>

    <p>Speaking of straps, ours (forehead and chin straps) have been redesigned with a more or less elastic fabric and folded into three sections. The folds allow for better accommodation of the chin or forehead. This second version is therefore more anatomical, providing more effective support, better fit, and increased comfort.</p>

    <p>To secure the patient on the scoop, we have recreated 3 straps. Unlike in Prototype I, the new straps are much wider and the buckles are more robust and durable. Additionally, these straps go around the body twice, providing a more effective hold. We repurposed the straps and buckles from old vacuum mattresses.</p>

    <p>To attach these straps, whether there are 2 or 3 depending on the size and morphology, slots have been created on the sleeves to access those on the scoop. These slots also allow paramedics to remove and transport the entire setup (scoop and patient). Small straps between the slots on the scoop have been created to provide more options for adjusting the straps.

    <p>For the head blocks, we decided to shorten them by half. Originally 12 cm in height, they are now reduced to 6 cm. This adjustment allows the straps to make contact with the head of the young patient.</p>

    <p>To create them, we used a 6 cm diameter pool noodle, which we cut to the correct dimensions and covered with pieces of our professional fabric. We installed two Velcro strips on each head block : the white ones to attach them to the base, and the black ones to secure the chin strap and forehead strap.</p>

    <p>The head blocks in the second prototype were originally designed to be installed on their side, creating two different sizes. However, we encountered a problem during production. We needed to attach male Velcro strips to them, but when placed upright, the Velcro strips intended for side attachment ended up on the side facing the head. Direct contact of male Velcro with the skin would have caused irritation and increased patient agitation due to significant discomfort. Therefore, we decided to keep the head blocks rounded and fixed in place, as they are intended to be low-profile from the start, which does not pose an issue.</p>

    <p>In our first prototype, the head blocks were attached directly to the socks. Due to a lack of hands (managing a Manual Immobilization and Lift and Scoop with two paramedics), for comfort (to fill the gap between the two hemispheres), and to clear the upper airway (complex spinal column in infants), we decided, after consulting professionals, to create a base specifically suited for younger children.</p>

    <p>For the creation of the base, we were fortunate to have Ellaâ€™s father provide a wooden board cut to the correct dimensions and angles. We then covered it with the same plastic fabric used for the rest of the prototype.</p>

    <p>We also created a cushion sewn in the middle to leave an indentation where the occiput can rest. To attach it, we covered it with a rectangle of plastic fabric directly on the base.</p>

    <p>For the Velcro on this base, we sewed them, with the help of our sewing expert, to attach the large head blocks.</p>

    <p>Having decided to remove the H-strap from the first prototype due to the pressure it exerted, particularly on the chin, we sought an alternative method to attach the base to the scoop. Instead of the H-strap, we opted for a different approach. While sewing the top and bottom parts of the base, we included plastic fabric tabs to create eyelets. These eyelets allow us to pass strap fasteners through, enabling a secure, uniform, and easy attachment of the base to the scoop.</p>
