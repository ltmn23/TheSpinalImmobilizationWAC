    <h2>EXPERIMENTS</h2>

    <p>To test our prototype, we created a model of a spine. We used uncooked spaghetti to roughly represent the spinal cord and potential lesions within the spinal canal. By running the same test 30 times, we aimed to count and compare the number of spaghetti strands that broke with and without Prototype I.</p>

    <p>Since Léa's father is the director of the Provincial School of Ambulance Emergency Responders of Hainaut, we had the opportunity to borrow an ambulance to test our first prototype. We used a spinal model with 5 uncooked spaghetti strands in each of the three areas: cervical spine, thoracic spine, and lumbar spine. We conducted a series of test drives with the device secured on the stretcher inside the ambulance. Each broken spaghetti strand represented a risk of spinal cord injury. The more spaghetti strands that broke, the greater the risk of permanent paralysis. Therefore, we hoped to see fewer broken strands with the prototype than without it.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, the tests were inconclusive. After inserting the spaghetti into the spinal model and wrapping the whole setup in a blanket to simulate a body, we asked a friend of Léa, who was experienced in driving ambulances, if he could come and carry out the test drives with the vehicle. He agreed. However, after making several rounds and attempting various turns, we noticed that none of the spaghetti strands had broken, even without our prototype. Despite our efforts to break the spaghetti without immobilization, we had to conclude that no results would be obtained from this experiment. Due to time constraints, we were unable to test the prototype properly, leaving us empty-handed with no results.</p>

    <p>Upon returning to school, we discussed the issue with our biology teacher, who advised us to redo the experiment using a different material. We decided to try meringue and plaster. During the lab session, we prepared meringue sticks and also made plaster sticks. After curing them, we attempted to remove the meringue sticks from the parchment paper. However, they were far too fragile and broke instantly. We then focused on the plaster sticks, as they were a perfect balance between the meringue, which broke just by being touched, and the spaghetti, which was too flexible or solid.</p>

    <p>We decided to produce no fewer than 120 plaster sticks to conduct at least 20 tests with and 20 tests without the prototype. A broken stick represents a risk of spinal injury and, consequently, the risk of paralysis.
    </p><p>
    As with the spaghetti, we placed one stick in each of the three zones: cervical, dorsal, and lumbar. We then defined a walking route (walking, turning around, climbing stairs, etc.) to be repeated. Unfortunately, we were unable to use an ambulance again due to time constraints.

    <h3>Testing Without the Prototype (Control Experiment) :</h3>

    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
      <li><strong>Cervical Spine : </strong>9 fractures</li>
      <li><strong>Dorsal Spine : </strong>28 fractures</li>
      <li><strong>Lumbar Spine : </strong>11 fractures</li>
      <li><strong>Total : </strong>48 fractures</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Testing With Prototype I :</h3>

    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
      <li><strong>Cervical Spine : </strong>6 fractures</li>
      <li><strong>Dorsal Spine : </strong>12 fractures</li>
      <li><strong>Lumbar Spine : </strong>3 fractures</li>
      <li><strong>Total : </strong>21 fractures</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Our results are both highly satisfactory and encouraging. They demonstrate that our prototype reduced the risk of spinal injury by 56.25%, a significant improvement, especially considering this is our first prototype.</p>

    <h3>Testing with Prototype II :</h3>

    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
      <li>2 fractures at the cervical spine</li>
      <li>5 fractures at the dorsal spine</li>
      <li>1 fracture at the lumbar spine</li>
      <li>Total: 8 fractures</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Percentage Reduction in the Risk of Spinal Injury :</h3>

    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
      <li><strong>From Control Experiment to Prototype I : </strong>65.25%</li>
      <li><strong>From Prototype I to Prototype II : </strong>62%</li>
      <li><strong>From Control Experiment to Prototype II : </strong>88.33% (to be verified)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These figures demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of our prototypes over time, encouraging us to continue with the project.</p>
